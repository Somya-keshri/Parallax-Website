        <h2>Mountains</h2>
        <p>
            “A window into the reflection of life, inside my soul lies a deep yearning to climb the peak up above the snow clad mountains of Himalayas! A time will come when I look at that mirror, where I don’t see the reflection at all for I’ll be one with these mountains of glory!” Journey to the mountains is always a belief! A belief beyond a shadow of an underdog’s achievement towards glory! A hope, a dream and an experience that we take upon ourselves to feel that exhilarating madness that you derive after you climb the peak and reach the top! One that you can only find when you surrender yourself to the unknown trails, paths, like your destiny that lead you to a mesmerising sunrise, or an enchanting sunset! Traveling across the beauty of organic and natural surroundings without any worldly worries. That’s something that I yearn for, especially when I want to detox, unwind and just completely disappear into the wilderness.

        <h2>Grasses & Trees</h2>
        <p>
            In nature, I enjoy trees and streams and the smell of fresh trees and grass more than anything. The special silence of nature and the sound of the wind that wraps around the branches and the sound of birds are pleasing to me. I take refuge in nature to escape the noise of the city and the cars and the noise of people.Imagine a world without plants and trees! (scary, right!?) I believe that plants and trees make the earth so beautiful. They are also very healing. Human beings as well as animals were created to live in close harmony with nature.
